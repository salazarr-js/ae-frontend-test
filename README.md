## Considerations

There are already several very good rich text editors on the market, fully customizable and extendable by plugins, some of them even are supported by `vue` as is shown in this [Medium post](https://medium.com/mounoydev/vue-component-rich-text-editor-wysiwyg-59b57052d5b3), and in this [repo](https://github.com/dok/awesome-text-editing).

Some of the most recommendable for `vue` use are [Tiptap](https://tiptap.scrumpy.io/) and [Prosemirror Toolkit](https://prosemirror.net/).

By consideration of this test, the entire text editor is built from scratch using the `execCommand` API on `contenteditable` element, which is experimental and not recommended for production projects
